[Visit Anteskog's Game Reviews Here](https://anteskogs-game-reviews-c55343667d70.herokuapp.com/)

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. During development I made use of Googles Developer Tools to ensure everything was working as expected and to assist me with troubleshooting when things didn't work as they should.

I have gone through each page of the site using the Chrome Developer Tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices, as well as manually testing this using a variety of devices in person.

## Validation Testing

### HTML

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the site. It was also used to validate the CSS. As the site is created with Django and utilises Django templating language within the HTML, I have checked the HTML by inspecting the page source and then running this through the validator.

| Page | Result | Evidence |

### CSS

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the CSS.

| File | Result | Evidence |

| CSS | Pass | 



### Python

[Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python. I have also installed [PyCodeStyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#configuration) in my IDE to enable me to check my code meets PEP8 guidelines during development.

## Automated Testing

Automated testing for this project was carried out with [Django TestCase](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/). I would write a test, run the test and fix any issues raised before running the test again to confirm it passed. When a test passed I committed it to GitHub.

I also used [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/) to enable me to see where I was missing tests from to enable me to test my application more thoroughly.

I have really enjoyed using unit tests for this project, and am looking forward to delving deeper into the topic to enable me to be able to test my applications more thoroughly.
