[Visit Anteskog's Game Reviews Here](https://anteskogs-game-reviews-c55343667d70.herokuapp.com/)

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. During development I made use of Googles Developer Tools to ensure everything was working as expected and to assist me with troubleshooting when things didn't work as they should.

I have gone through each page of the site using the Chrome Developer Tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices, as well as manually testing this using a variety of devices in person.

## Validation Testing

### HTML

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the site. It was also used to validate the CSS. As the site is created with Django and utilises Django templating language within the HTML, I have checked the HTML by inspecting the page source and then running this through the validator.
